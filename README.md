# ForestFireAnalysis
This project was completed as part of a coursework assignment in my 2nd year at University with a grading of 98%.

The document, in the form of a jupyter notebook, analyses the main factors of forest fire occurrences within specific regions of Algeria and creates a model to predict future occurrences.
